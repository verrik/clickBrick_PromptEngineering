# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategies for Clinical NLP with LLMs

## Overview

This project explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to real-world clinical data — with a particular focus on **unstructured free text** from electronic health records (EHRs) and other high-validity clinical sources. Given the sensitive nature of such data and the complexity of applying emerging LLM capabilities, this work aims to systematically investigate **prompt engineering strategies** and their impact on model performance.

While in-context learning has shown promise in adapting LLMs to clinical NLP tasks, most published studies provide only limited insight into how prompts were developed, evaluated, or refined. This project addresses that gap by emphasizing **transparent, reproducible prompt design** workflows.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Develop and document **iterative prompt engineering workflows** for clinical text analysis  
- Compare **prompt variants** using structured experiments across fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and zero/few-shot prompting  
- Highlight reproducibility concerns arising from reliance on **proprietary LLMs** with limited access or version stability  
- Advocate for the inclusion of **complete prompt text**, model details, and evaluation strategies in clinical LLM research

## 🔍 Why This Matters

Clinical NLP research often suffers from:
- 🚫 Incomplete reporting of prompt development methods  
- 📉 Limited reproducibility due to restricted access to proprietary models  
- 🔍 Lack of systematic evaluation of fine-grained prompt variants  
- ⚠️ High stakes for model accuracy and safety in clinical contexts  

This project aims to create a reusable, extensible framework for **transparent prompt engineering** in biomedical NLP research.
